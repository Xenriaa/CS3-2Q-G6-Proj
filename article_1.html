    <h2>Root Causes</h2>
    <p><i>5 main problems</i></p>
	<p><h6> Writer: Blaizy Marie <br> Coder: Jose Marcelo </h6></p>
    <p class="definition" style="margin-left: 375px; margin-right: 375px" > Housing is a fundamental human right, yet millions worldwide lack access to it. According to a 2005 survey, over 1.5 billion people live without adequate housing. However, obtaining precise data is challenging due to varying definitions of homelessness across countries and the high cost of tracking the issue. Despite limited updated records, homelessness is recognized as a growing concern globally, with rates rising in many nations in recent years. Below are 5 root causes of homelessness: </p>

		<strong> The causes of Homelessness </strong>
		<br>
		<br>
		•Stagnant wages: 
		<br> <br>
		The growing gap between rising living costs and stagnant wages makes it increasingly difficult for people to afford basic expenses or save for emergencies and long-term needs. Without sufficient savings, unexpected expenses can quickly overwhelm an individual’s income. Globally, low wages contribute to poverty and increase the risk of homelessness.
		<br>
		<br>
		•Unemployment 
		<br> <br>
		While low wages contribute to homelessness, unemployment is also a significant factor. Reasons for unemployment vary and some countries have higher rates than others. Once a person is unemployed for a time, they can easily slip into homelessness. Research shows that most unhoused people want to work but face obstacles, such as not having a permanent address.

	<strong> The causes of Homelessness </strong>
	<br>
	<br>
	•Lack of affordable housing
	<br>
	<br>
	The high cost of housing is a widespread problem. According to a global survey by the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, 90% of 200 surveyed cities were classified as unaffordable, with average home prices exceeding three times the median income. Without affordable housing options, individuals face limited choices, making it difficult to secure homes near jobs or in safe neighborhoods.
	<br>
	<br>
	•Lack of affordable healthcare
	<br>
	<br>
	Healthcare costs are extremely high, yet many individuals lack adequate insurance or have none at all. This forces them to spend significant portions of their income on medical expenses while also struggling to cover essentials like rent, food, and utilities. Skipping routine checkups and treatments to save money can result in more costly medical issues later. A single serious illness or accident can quickly lead to homelessness for individuals or families.

	<strong> The causes of Homelessness </strong>
	<br>
	<br>
	•Poverty
	<br>
	<br>
	Poverty is a leading global cause of homelessness, driven by factors such as stagnant wages, unemployment, and the rising costs of housing and healthcare. When individuals or families cannot afford basic needs like shelter, food, and education, their risk of becoming homeless significantly increases. Tackling homelessness requires governments and organizations to focus on reducing poverty.
